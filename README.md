🚀Project main objective: Fog-based Poisoning Detection in Heterogeneous Environment

🚀https://github.com/h-haran/-Federated-Learning-cyber

💻My AWS Setup

Launched a Windows EC2 instance in the EU North (Stockholm) region (windows servers)

Created and attached EBS volumes to support federated learning model

🔧 Issues Faced

Remote Desktop Connection Failed

High Latency

So modified EC2 Zones from EU to ap-1-south Mumbai updated instance types

Gone through

Elastic IPs, DNS to fix RDP connection issue after server Start / Stop

IAM Roles

To grant access to my S3 buckets from my EC2 instances

IAM User 

For local machines

Still lot to go on with Python scripts and Poisson attack detection
